# What is this repo?

This is a demo of the rental NFT feature designed by Ternoa.
It will be presented during the tech AMA on Thursday 22th of December 2022.

The use case presented here is inspired from house rental platforms (e.g. Airbnb).
The flat owner (NFT's owner) creates a contract that put his flat's key (his NFT) for renting for a fixed duration. A rentee can then rent this key and enter into the flat.
